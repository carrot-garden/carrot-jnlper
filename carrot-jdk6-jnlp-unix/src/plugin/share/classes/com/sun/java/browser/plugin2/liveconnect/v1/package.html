Provides an inter-language bridge between the JavaScript engine in the
web browser and arbitrary languages hosted on the Java&trade;
platform.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>

The Java platform and virtual machine implementation hosts both Java
and non-Java language implementations. Developers can write many
different kinds of programs in these languages, including desktop
applications and applets in the web browser.

</p>
<p>

When a Java program is hosted as an applet in the browser, JavaScript
on the web page may interact with it, and call methods, access fields,
and create new Java objects. The capability of a web page to interact
with a Java applet originated in the Netscape browser and is
generically called "LiveConnect".

</p>
<p>

This package provides interfaces to support calling into arbitrary
languages hosted on the Java platform from the JavaScript engine in
the web browser. Using these interfaces, the language implementor can
customize:

<ul>

<li> How JavaScript field accesses and sets, array accesses, and
     method invocations work against objects in the language
<li> How new object instances are created from JavaScript
<li> How values are converted back and forth between the JavaScript
     engine and the language
<li> Which fields and methods are visible to the JavaScript engine,
     including creating synthetic fields with special semantics
</ul>

</p>
<p>

The applet's content can then be accessed from JavaScript on the web
page. For example, HTML links or buttons on the web page can call into
the applet or objects referred to by the applet to affect its state.
Some of the objects returned to the web browser might correspond to a
third-party language hosted on the Java platform, in which case the
language implementor defines the mapping between JavaScript syntax on
the web page and their language.

</p>
<p>

<em>Naming convention note:</em> it is anticipated that these APIs may
need to change in incompatible ways in the future, as concepts like
conversion costs and algorithms for overloaded method resolution and
invocation are refined. For this reason the package name contains
{@code v1} to indicate version 1 of the inter-language LiveConnect
bridge.
