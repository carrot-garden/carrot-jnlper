Applet Drag and Drop Tests
</H1>

<P>

These tests illustrate the functionality in the new Java Plug-In of
dragging applets out of the web browser to the desktop.

</P>

<H2>
Test 1: Basic
</H2>

<p>

This test uses only the most basic functionality of the drag and drop
support. It does not customize the look or behavior. Use Alt + Left
Click + Drag to drag the applet out of the browser. A small floating
close box will appear at the upper right of the applet once it is
dragged out of the browser. To move the applet around afterward, use
the same gesture. Click the close button to close the applet. If the
web page where the applet came from is still open when it is closed,
it will pop back into its original place on the web page; otherwise,
it will be shut down.

</p>
<p>

The "Reopen Web Page" button uses AppletContext.showDocument() to
re-display the web page from which the applet came. Note that it
works, launching the default system browser, even if the browser has
been completely shut down after the applet was launched.

</p>
<p>

The "Connect Back to Server" button opens a URLConnection back to the
server and downloads some data. If the web page originally hosting the
applet has been left or the browser has been shut down, this exercises
the code path where a proxy query is made with no browser to support
it.

<applet code="DragTest1" width="200" height="200">
    <param name="draggable" value="true">
</applet>

</p>
<p>
HTML:
<PRE>
  &lt;applet code="DragTest1" width="200" height="200"&gt;
      &lt;param name="draggable" value="true"&gt;
  &lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE>
Source code: <a href="DragTest1.java">DragTest1.java</a>
<p>

<H2>
Test 2: More Advanced
</H2>

<p>

This test uses some of the more advanced functionality, in particular
customizing the drag gesture and look and feel of the close button.
Click and drag with the left mouse button in the red region to move
the applet around. Note that if any modifier keys are held down, the
click will be deliberately ignored. Click the "x" in the upper right
of the applet to shut it down. Note that the close behavior is the
same as in test 1, only the displaying of the close button is now
handled by the applet.
