      This test fails in the browser,
      since the browser will instantiate both applets at once (multithreaded).

      The first applet.start() method is called after both applets are created,
      therefor the second applet cannot connect to the 1st applet's SingleInstanceServer.

      The SingleInstanceServer is started with the very first SingleInstanceService.addSingleInstanceListener(),
      which of course can only be done in the applet.start() method .. as a very first point in time.

      We have to think about, if this is a bug, or a feature :)

      A solution might be to change the applet creation sequence, i.e:
        - For all applet's 
            - create/instanciate
            - init
            - start

      instead of (current situation):
        - For all applet's 
            - create/instanciate
        - For all applet's 
            - init
            - start
