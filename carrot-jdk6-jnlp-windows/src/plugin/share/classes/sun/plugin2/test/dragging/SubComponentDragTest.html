Sub-Component Drag Test
</H1>

<p>

This test verifies that an applet containing sub-components can be
dragged correctly. Use Alt + Left Click + Drag to drag the applet out
of the browser and move it around the screen. The applet should always
appear to stick to the mouse pointer and should never appear to jump
around under the mouse pointer. In particular try initiating drags in
the red regions.

<applet code="DragTest3" width="200" height="200">
    <param name="draggable" value="true">
